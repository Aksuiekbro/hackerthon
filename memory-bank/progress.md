# Project Progress & Status

## Current Overall Status
Initial project scaffolding for backend (FastAPI) and frontend (Next.js with shadcn/ui) is complete. Memory Bank is initialized and updated. Next steps involve environment setup (e.g., `.env.example`) and version control.

## What Works
- **Memory Bank:**
  - `memory-bank/` directory created.
  - All core Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`) created and populated with initial/updated information.
- `.clinerules` file exists (provided by user).
- **Backend (FastAPI):**
  - `/backend` directory and subdirectories (`/api`, `/ml_core`, `/db`) created.
  - `backend/main.py`: Basic FastAPI app initialized, upload router included (imports corrected to relative).
  - `backend/api/upload.py`: Stub `/upload` endpoint created, calls mock ML function (imports corrected to relative).
  - `backend/ml_core/highlight.py`: Mock highlight extraction function created.
  - `backend/requirements.txt`: Created with initial dependencies, `python-multipart` added for form data handling.
- **Frontend (Next.js):**
  - `/frontend` directory initialized as a Next.js project (TypeScript, Tailwind, ESLint, App Router, src-dir).
  - `shadcn` initialized.
  - Dependencies `axios` and `@supabase/supabase-js` installed.
  - `frontend/src/app/page.tsx`: Created with a basic video upload form and logic to display (mocked) highlights from the backend.
  - Required shadcn/ui components (`button`, `input`, `card`, `alert`) added.

## What's In Progress
- Updating Memory Bank files to reflect completed scaffolding (this task).
- Preparing for environment setup and version control.

## What's Next / To Do
Based on `projectbrief.md` and `activeContext.md`:
1.  **Environment Setup:**
    -   Create a template `.env` file (e.g., `.env.example`) in the project root with placeholders for Supabase credentials (`DATABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_KEY`) and frontend public variables (`NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`).
2.  **Version Control:**
    -   Initialize Git repository (`git init`) if not already done by Next.js setup (Next.js `create-next-app` usually does this).
    -   Create/update a comprehensive `.gitignore` file for Python, Node.js, and OS-specific files.
    -   Make an initial commit of the scaffolded project.
3.  **Testing the Vertical Slice (Manual):**
    -   Set up Python virtual environment for backend: `cd backend && python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt`.
    -   Run backend dev server from project root: `python3 -m uvicorn backend.main:app --reload --app-dir .` (or `PYTHONPATH=. uvicorn backend.main:app --reload`). This ensures `backend` is treated as a package and relative imports work.
    -   Run frontend dev server: `cd frontend && npm run dev`.
    -   Test video upload from frontend to backend and display of mock highlights.
4.  (Optional) Create `frontend/src/lib/supabase.ts` and `frontend/src/api.ts` for more structured client-side API/Supabase logic if desired.

## Known Issues & Bugs
- The `roo-code-memory-bank-mcp` tool's `initialize_memory_bank` function is not usable due to incorrect path handling (tries to write to `/memory-bank`). Workaround (manual file creation) implemented.
- Backend Python imports initially caused `ModuleNotFoundError` when running `uvicorn` from within the `backend` directory. Corrected to use relative imports.
- Subsequently, relative imports caused `ImportError: attempted relative import with no known parent package` when `uvicorn main:app --reload` was run from `backend/`. The solution is to run Uvicorn from the project root, specifying the app as `backend.main:app` and ensuring the project root is in `PYTHONPATH` (e.g. using `--app-dir .`).
- FastAPI requires `python-multipart` for file uploads; added to `requirements.txt`.

## Key Decisions Log
- **2025-05-17:** Decided to manually create Memory Bank files using `write_to_file` tool due to issues with the `roo-code-memory-bank-mcp` tool. This ensures project context is captured despite tool limitations.
- **2025-05-17:** Initial Memory Bank files populated based on the content of `projectbrief.md` provided in the user's task.
- **2025-05-17:** Corrected Python import paths in `backend/main.py` and `backend/api/upload.py` to use relative imports.
- **2025-05-17:** Identified that Uvicorn must be run from the project root (e.g., `python3 -m uvicorn backend.main:app --reload --app-dir .`) for relative imports within the `backend` package to work correctly.
- **2025-05-17:** Added `python-multipart` to `backend/requirements.txt` as it's required by FastAPI for form data/file uploads.

## Milestones
- **Milestone 0: Project Initialization & Memory Bank Setup**
  - [x] `memory-bank/` directory and core files created.
  - [x] Core Memory Bank files populated with initial data from `projectbrief.md`.
- **Milestone 1: Basic Vertical Slice (Video Upload & Mock Highlights)** (as per `projectbrief.md`)
  - [x] Backend: `/backend/api/upload` endpoint created (stub, calls mock ML).
  - [x] Backend: `/backend/ml_core/highlight.py` mock function created.
  - [x] Backend: `requirements.txt` created and updated with `python-multipart`.
  - [x] Frontend: Next.js project initialized with necessary dependencies (`axios`, `@supabase/supabase-js`).
  - [x] Frontend: shadcn initialized and `button`, `input`, `card`, `alert` components added.
  - [x] Frontend: `/frontend/src/app/page.tsx` created with basic upload form, calls backend, displays mock results.
  - [x] Frontend: `package.json` reflects necessary dependencies.
  - [ ] Frontend & Backend: Vertical slice tested end-to-end (manually).
- **Milestone 2: Supabase Integration (Optional for MVP)**
  - [ ] Backend: Connects to Supabase for storing video metadata/highlights.
  - [ ] Frontend: Uses Supabase for user authentication (OAuth).
- **Milestone 3: Real ML Core Integration (Post-MVP/Hackathon)**
  - [ ] Replace mock `highlight.py` with actual ML logic.
